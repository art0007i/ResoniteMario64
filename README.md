# ResoniteMario64

A [BepisLoader](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader) mod
for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to spawn in and control mario from Super Mario 64.

To spawn mario use the "Spawn Mario" button from the public folder (Or any button tagged with "SpawnMario").
You can also find a bunch of useful prefabs like interactables or different types of colliders in that folder.

Made possible by [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64).
I also used [CVRSuperMario64](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/CVRSuperMario64) as a reference for
creating this.

### Public Folder

- resrec:///U-NepuShiro/R-065B56789441685C8048321B0F9D5AAA43F9624971A9223CD6B5D4FE311FB1E2

### Castle Grounds World

- resrec:///U-NepuShiro/R-d4f4561f-8083-43cc-9cfc-f94bf8fc17ef

## Installation

1. Install [BepisLoader](https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader).
2. Place [ResoniteMario64.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/ResoniteMario64/releases/latest/download/ResoniteMario64.dll)
   into your `BepInEx\plugins` folder. This folder should be at
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\BepInEx\plugins` for a default install. You can create it if it's
   missing, or if you launch the game once with BepisLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Find `Super Mario 64 [US].z64` with MD5 hash `20b854b239203baf6c961b850a4a51a2` rename it to `baserom.us.z64` then place
      it next to the `ResoniteMario64.dll`, in the same folder as Resonite, `rml_libs` or `rml_mods`.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
